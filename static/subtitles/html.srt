it's super easy what do you have to lose

30
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,159
building a website is a lot like

31
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,400
building a house first we need a solid

32
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,240
foundation and we need to build a

33
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,320
skeletal structure that's where html

34
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,479
comes in it's the most basic building

35
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,479
block of the web then after that we can

36
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,159
add css css is cascading style sheets

37
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,960
with css we can style color and change

38
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,040
the appearance of a webpage and lastly

39
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,119
there's javascript javascript adds

40
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,680
functionality to a webpage so in a house

41
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,000
this could be like plumbing heating and

42
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,320
air conditioning and electricity so it

43
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,320
adds functionality and when you combine

44
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,400
these three levels you have a good

45
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,000
functioning webpage but you need to

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,520
start somewhere so that's why you're

47
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,600
gonna learn html first what will you

48
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,759
need you'll need a web browser use

49
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,920
whatever web browser that you like just

50
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,159
please do not use internet explorer and

51
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,799
we'll also need a text editor to write

52
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,000
html code you can use vs code sublime

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,479
text heck you can even use notepad but i

54
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,640
prefer vs code so i'll show you where to

55
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,880
download that head to

56
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,000
code.visualstudio.com and download the

57
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,758
correct version for your operating

58
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,760
system i'm running windows so i'm going

59
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,920
to install the windows version then i

60
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,599
will open when done

61
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,760
accept the agreement

62
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,840
yes i actually did read it that fast i

63
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,239
would recommend creating a desktop icon

64
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,959
and make sure add to path is selected

65
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,680
next and install and then you might as

66
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,319
well launch this bad boy so finish we

67
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,640
are now within vs code the first thing i

68
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,200
recommend is to download the live server

69
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,680
extension so that after saving an html

70
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,080
document we can immediately refresh a

71
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,800
web page so underneath the search box

72
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,840
for extensions we are looking for live

73
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,480
server and install this version then

74
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,239
after downloading the live server

75
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,720
extension we will create a new folder

76
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,519
under the explorer tab open folder

77
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,599
wherever you want create a new folder

78
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,200
i'll create this on my desktop just for

79
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,000
convenience i'm going to create a new

80
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,640
folder i'll name this website

81
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,720
or whatever you want doesn't matter

82
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,040
then select folder and within our

83
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,959
website folder we're going to create a

84
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,519
new file name this index.html

85
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,519
whatever file you would like to be the

86
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,440
home page of your website you'll want to

87
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,920
name that as

88
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,360
index.html when a connection is made to

89
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,000
a website without a specific file in the

90
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,440
url most servers by default will return

91
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,200
the

92
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,200
index.html file as a landing page so

93
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,000
this index.html file will be the home

94
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,640
page the landing page of our website at

95
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,239
the top of our document we're going to

96
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,480
type this within angle brackets

97
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,400
exclamation point doc type html

98
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,799
html documents should start with this

99
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,440
declaration to be compliant with basic

100
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,080
html standards it lets a visitor's web

101
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,040
browser know that this is an html5

102
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,120
document and following this text will

103
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,480
create a pair of html tags tags are the

104
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,560
keywords within angle brackets that a

105
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,879
web page uses to define how your web

106
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,200
browser will format and display content

107
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,280
and usually these come in pairs so we'll

108
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,480
need an opening html tag and a closing

109
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,279
html tag all of our html code will be

110
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,880
within these html tags so the html

111
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,440
element represents the root of an html

112
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,919
document and there's two major sections

113
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,800
head and body so let's create a pair of

114
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,600
head tags head represents information

115
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,320
about a web page and there is also body

116
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,280
as well so create a pair of body tags

117
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,040
the body is what you would like to

118
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,120
display to a user the head is

119
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,360
information about the web page one thing

120
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,880
that we can add to the head of our

121
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,000
document is a title so we'll need a pair

122
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,040
of title tags

123
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,400
and let's create a title for our website

124
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,360
my

125
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,160
first website and then let's save let's

126
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,080
open this document so i'm going to right

127
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,800
click open with live server so the title

128
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,680
of this web page is my first website and

129
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,440
you may have noticed that this web

130
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,240
browser was opened with edge so you can

131
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,160
actually change that to a different web

132
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,039
browser and here's how go to file

133
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,400
preferences

134
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,680
settings

135
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,479
underneath extensions head to

136
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,320
live server config

137
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,199
custom browser and select a web browser

138
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,520
of your choosing so right click open

139
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,000
with live server and we are now using a

140
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,759
different web browser so i'm just going

141
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,560
to put my web browser and vs code side

142
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,880
by side

143
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,280
now let's add some text to the body of

144
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,840
our webpage type whatever you want i

145
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,840
like pizza

146
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,919
then i'm going to save

147
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,400
there we go we added some text to the

148
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,800
body of our html document and we can

149
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,520
also use a pair of header tags so

150
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,199
surround some text with h1 this is the

151
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,600
largest header tag and then make sure to

152
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,680
close it afterwards okay so then we have

153
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,479
h2 which is smaller

154
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,600
we have h3

155
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,160
h4

156
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,120
h5

157
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,880
and the last one is h6

158
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,560
so if you need some sort of title for

159
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,319
your web page you can always play some

160
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,919
text within a pair of h1 header tags

161
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,000
before i discuss p tags we should

162
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,319
discuss what elements are elements

163
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,960
embody the opening tag any content

164
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,360
within and the closing tag so for

165
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,560
example this is a opening title tag and

166
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,039
a closing title tag and all of these

167
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,280
together including any content within is

168
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,319
known as the title element so that's the

169
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,880
difference between tags and elements

170
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,919
tags make up a portion of elements and

171
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,599
with that out of the way we can move on

172
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,080
to paragraph elements paragraph elements

173
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,160
are made up of p tags we need an opening

174
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,960
p tag and a closing piece egg and we can

175
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,280
type some text within these paragraph

176
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,400
tags

177
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,319
this is some sample text browsers

178
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,039
automatically add a blank line of before

179
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,840
and after any paragraph elements also if

180
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,160
you need some longer sample text there

181
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,360
is a shortcut type lorem then tab

182
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,120
and that will create some sample text

183
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,199
for you and let's create another

184
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,520
paragraph element so we need an opening

185
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,319
p tag and a closing p tag i would like

186
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,720
some more sample text i will type lorem

187
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,599
then tab and we now have two paragraph

188
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,840
elements if you need a paragraph of

189
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,319
information to display with blank lines

190
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,240
before and after you can always surround

191
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,039
some text within a pair of p tags now

192
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,560
there's also a br element and these do

193
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,479
not need closing tags it's only an

194
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,319
opening tag wherever you would like to

195
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,000
add a line break just add a br element

196
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,919
so let's say i would like to space out

197
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,479
these header tags well i can add a line

198
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,800
break between each of these

199
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,280
if you ever need a line break just use a

200
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,840
vr element and like i said there's no

201
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,080
closing tag with these elements there's

202
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,280
also an hr element and i do not mean

203
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,479
human resources i mean horizontal rule

204
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,479
if you ever need to divide your page

205
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,479
section by section you can always add a

206
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,800
horizontal rule let's say that we have a

207
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,960
title to this webpage i'll create an h1

208
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,199
header tag this is my website

209
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,879
and then i'm just going to close this

210
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,319
what if i would like to divide this

211
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,960
webpage section by section i can always

212
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,679
add a horizontal rule by using an hr

213
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,080
element and there is no closing tag with

214
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,000
this element you just type hr with an

215
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,719
angle brackets and this will divide a

216
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,479
section of your webpage and add a

217
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,880
horizontal rule which looks pretty nice

218
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,920
so that is the hr element and the last

219
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,279
thing we're going to discuss for this

220
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,680
topic is comments comments will not be

221
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,360
displayed within the body of your

222
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,000
document it's more or less a note for

223
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,320
yourself or other developers to create a

224
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,399
comment we need an angle bracket

225
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,640
exclamation point then two dashes and

226
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,240
this will create the ending of your

227
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,000
comment which is an arrow pointing to

228
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,640
the right so anything between these two

229
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,040
arrows will be a comment i'll leave a

230
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,839
comment for i don't know myself

231
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,240
this is the best website ever

232
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,160
so as you can see this will not be

233
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,080
displayed within my webpage it's

234
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,120
basically used as a note for yourself or

235
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,440
for other people looking over this html

236
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,000

250
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,200
running

251
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,399
sup people so hyperlinks we can apply a

252
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,760
hyperlink to text buttons images

253
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,760
elements of that nature whatever you

254
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,600
would like to turn into a hyperlink

255
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,160
surround with a pair of a tags

256
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,480
there's an opening a tag and a closing a

257
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,040
tag and within the opening a tag there

258
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,760
is an href attribute that you can set to

259
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,959
a url of your choosing so if i want this

260
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,880
hyperlink to take me to google then i

261
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,320
will fill out the url for google

262
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,360
so after saving if i click on this link

263
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,920
it takes me to google easy enough right

264
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,320
now there is a target attribute you can

265
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,959
open a web page in a new tab or window

266
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,800
by setting this to underscore blank

267
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,959
so this should open in a new tab or

268
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:47,920
window

269
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,720
but the default is self

270
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,399
so that this will open in the same

271
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,360
window there is a title a title is a

272
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,279
small pop-up box that will appear when

273
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,519
you hover your cursor over this link we

274
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,760
could write a message like this

275
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,720
takes you to google

276
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,640
and that box should appear after you

277
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,200
hover your cursor over this hyperlink

278
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,360
this takes you to google let's say you

279
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,959
have another webpage and you would like

280
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,959
this link to take you to your second

281
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,519
page let's change the text

282
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,720
uh go to page two i'm going to create

283
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,040
another html file real quick i'll go to

284
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,200
new file let's call this page two dot

285
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,880
html

286
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,880
if you need to generate the necessary

287
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,959
body of an html document if you're using

288
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,680
vs code you can type exclamation point

289
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,040
and then tab

290
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,279
and let's write a message

291
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,480
this is page two

292
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,040
if i set the href attribute equal to the

293
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,279
relative file path of whatever page i

294
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,600
would like to go to then this hyperlink

295
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,600
will take me there so these files are

296
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,120
right next to each other i only have to

297
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,200
list the file name so i would like this

298
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,880
hyperlink to take me to page2.htm

299
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,279
so if i click on this hyperlink

300
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,079
it will take me to my other html file

301
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,160
this is useful if you have a navigation

302
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,000
bar so depending on the link that

303
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,680
somebody clicks on your navigation bar

304
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,839
that can take you to a different page

305
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,440
and lastly you can send an email to

306
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,760
somebody within the href attribute type

307
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,200
mail to colon then some email address

308
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,800
let's say fake123 gmail.com

309
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,760
let's say email me instead

310
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,200
and then when you click on this link it

311
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,800
will begin the process of sending an

312
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,000
email

313
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,240
but we won't actually complete it so

314
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,079
yeah everybody those are hyperlinks you

315
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,639
can apply hyperlinks to text buttons

316
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,480
images which we'll have some practice

317
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,480
with in the future so yeah those are

318
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,240
hyperlinks and html

319
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,040
all right people here's how to add an

320
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,200
image to a web page find or download an

321
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,040
image of your choosing i just so happen

322
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,959
to have a picture of shrek within your

323
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,680
folder containing your index.html file

324
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,000
you're going to move or paste that image

325
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,839
within the same folder and within the

326
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,680
body element we're going to create a new

327
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,839
element an image element within angle

328
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,200
brackets type img for image this is a

329
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,920
self-closing tag and many elements have

330
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,839
different attributes that we can change

331
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,000
we need to change the source attribute

332
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,839
of this image element the source

333
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,279
attribute is src and we will set this

334
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,600
equal to within double quotes the name

335
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,720
of our image mine is shrek.png and then

336
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,600
save

337
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,360
what i like to do if i'm working with

338
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,600
the webpage that has a lot of images i

339
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,680
like to create a separate folder for my

340
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,240
images this isn't necessary but if your

341
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,160
image is located within a separate

342
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,320
folder we need to find the file path

343
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,199
relative to your index.html file so i'm

344
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,040
going to create a new folder and let's

345
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,199
name this images it will contain all the

346
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,519
images from my webpage then i will move

347
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,839
my image to my images folder so we can

348
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,839
no longer locate this image we need to

349
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,120
find the file path relative to the

350
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,199
index.html file to look within my images

351
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,519
folder i will precede the image name

352
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:58,399
with

353
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,240
forward slash the name of the folder

354
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,199
images slash the name of the image and

355
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,360
there it is personally if i'm working

356
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,680
with a lot of images i like to place all

357
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,240
of my images within one folder if you

358
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,079
decide to do that as well you just need

359
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,639
to precede the file name with the name

360
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,399
of the folder that it's in here's my

361
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,320
image but it's fairly massive we can

362
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,399
change the width and height attributes

363
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,480
if we need to i will change the height

364
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,320
attribute height equals maybe 200 and

365
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,279
that's a lot smaller maybe 300 that's a

366
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,959
little bit better the height and the

367
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,880
width will scale proportionately with

368
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,240
each other but you can change them

369
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,639
individually let's change the width

370
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,480
width equals

371
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,040
let's say 100

372
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,680
what we get is an extra skinnyshrek and

373
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,120
if i change this to maybe 600 well shrek

374
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,839
is extra thick now so i will just only

375
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,079
change the height attribute so that the

376
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,320
width attribute scales proportionately

377
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,240
now if somebody is visually impaired

378
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,160
they may be using a screen reader to

379
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,000
navigate a web page it would be good

380
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,079
practice to add some alternative text

381
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,320
that is read out loud by a screen reader

382
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,880
so that is the alt attribute within

383
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,560
double quotes i'll type a brief

384
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,320
description of this image

385
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,480
this is a picture of shrek so when you

386
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,920
add an image it's considered good

387
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,399
practice to add some alternative text

388
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,399
you can also add a title too a title

389
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,800
will be a small pop-up box that appears

390
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,120
when you hover your cursor over an image

391
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,440
to add a title set the title attribute

392
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,199
equal to some text

393
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,519
uh shrek is

394
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:32,880
shrek see

395
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,880
and then i'm going to save hover my

396
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,360
cursor over the image and we can see a

397
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,320
small pop-up box that has my title shrek

398
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,959
is shreksy we can also turn an image

399
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,440
into a hyperlink to turn this image into

400
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,360
a hyperlink we need to surround our

401
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,120
image element with an opening and

402
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,880
closing a tag

403
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,279
so open and close within the opening a

404
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,519
tag there is an href attribute that we

405
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,399
can set to a url of our choosing i think

406
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,720
i'll set this hyperlink to the wikipedia

407
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,440
page for shrek so just type in the url

408
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,399
between these double quotes save then if

409
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,320
i were to click on my image this will

410
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,639
take me to the wikipedia page for shrek

411
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,560
or some other url depending on what you

412
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,720
type here so yeah that's how to add an

413
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,800
image to a web page within the body

414
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,040
element you need to add an image element

415
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,040
and then set the source equal to the

416
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,639
image name if you found this video

417
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,560

become a fellow bro

421
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,800
if you do need an mp3 file to work with

422
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,720
for this video i recommend heading to

423
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,279
the youtube audio library and then you

424
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,880
can search and download a song of your

425
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,680
choosing so after you find an mp3 file

426
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,000
you can use a wav file too just drag and

427
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,360
drop it to your folder containing your

428
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,279
index.html file and then we can head to

429
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,920
vs code now to add audio to our web page

430
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,320
we need an audio element

431
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,440
so within angle brackets audio and list

432
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,800
the source equal to the name of your mp3

433
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,720
or wav file we're going to need some

434
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,679
controls so this is a boolean attribute

435
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,520
we don't need to set the sql to anything

436
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,679
it's either true or false and to set it

437
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,359
equal to true you just type the name of

438
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,679
the attribute so within the audio

439
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,319
element type controls and up top here we

440
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,039
have our controls for our mp3 file with

441
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,959
these controls we can play some audio

442
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,868
file of our choosing

443
00:17:25,868 --> 00:17:29,039
[Music]

444
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,940
we can fast forward

445
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:37,200
[Music]

446
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,880
and we can mute here's a couple other

447
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,200
boolean attributes we can have our audio

448
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,280
autoplay by using the autoplay boolean

449
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,280
attribute

450
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,360
if you would like this to be muted

451
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,480
originally type muted so this is playing

452
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,840
but you can't hear it because it's muted

453
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,720
if you need this to loop just type loop

454
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,280
yep and it's looping you can have backup

455
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,880
audio files just in case your web

456
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,120
browser doesn't support a given format

457
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,960
so if you would like some backup audio

458
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,640
files we're going to change this around

459
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,240
a little bit so let's get rid of our

460
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,320
source and we'll create an audio closing

461
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,200
tag

462
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,520
and we will create multiple nested

463
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,880
source elements

464
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,160
type source

465
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,200
source equals the name of one audio file

466
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,280
you would like to use primarily if you

467
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,320
have a backup let's say we have the same

468
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,960
song as a wav file you can do that too

469
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,880
if for some reason the browser using

470
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,960
doesn't support these first two audio

471
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,360
files you can always display a message

472
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,760
this browser does not support

473
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,679
html5

474
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,919
audio so yeah everybody that's how to

475
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,160
add audio to a web page you just have to

476
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,240
use this audio element and set the

477
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,480
source equal to an audio file of your

478
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,720
choosing and there's a bunch of boolean

479
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,240
attributes that you can add to if you

480
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,160
would like some controls if you need to

481
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,760
set this to autoplay if you need it

482
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,760
muted and if you need it to loop so yeah

483
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,919
that's how to add audio to a webpage if

484
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,600

all right welcome back everybody in this

489
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,919
video i'm going to show you all how we

490
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,240
can add a video to a web page you'll

491
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,799
need a video of one of these file types

492
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,720
when i was in tokyo some number of years

493
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,120
ago i saw a real-life mario kart racing

494
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,799
down the street so what i'm going to do

495
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,559
is place this mp4 file next to my

496
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:32,240
index.html file and then within vs code

497
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,320
we need a video element

498
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,280
and we will list the src attribute equal

499
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,039
to the name of our file that we're

500
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,080
working with

501
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,799
and in my case it's racing.mp4 now this

502
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:45,280
video is massive so let's change the

503
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,240
width of this using the width attribute

504
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,039
width equals what about

505
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,480
500

506
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,400
that's a lot better but we'll need some

507
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,400
controls to actually play this video i'm

508
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,000
clicking on this and nothing's happening

509
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,640
controls is a boolean attribute we only

510
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,400
have to list the attribute name to add

511
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,000
controls

512
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,840
there we go we now have some controls

513
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,000
[Music]

514
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,520
now if you want this to play maybe in

515
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,960
the background and you do not want

516
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,559
controls you can always set this to

517
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,559
autoplay

518
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:21,039
[Music]

519
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,280
so i'm going to add the controls back if

520
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,679
you need this muted just add the muted

521
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,159
boolean attribute

522
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:29,600
so it's playing but we can't hear

523
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,720
anything

524
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,640
and if you need this to loop just add

525
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,120
the loop boolean attribute and this

526
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,799
should loop

527
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,400
yeah there it is here's another thing

528
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,840
that we can try let's get rid of our

529
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,679
source attribute and we're going to

530
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,120
create a video closing tag

531
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,760
and we will create nested sources within

532
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,720
our video element

533
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,960
source src equals our video file so just

534
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,799
in case your browser doesn't support an

535
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,200
mp4 video file you can always create

536
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,760
another source

537
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,960
let's say that we have a web m file as a

538
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,120
backup just in case that this browser

539
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,440
doesn't support an mp4 file and if for

540
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,440
some reason that no other sources work

541
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,360
you can always add a note

542
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,159
this browser does not support

543
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:18,799
html5

544
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,960
audio so you can write it either way but

545
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,400
if you have multiple sources you can

546
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,400
always have backups just in case this

547
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,320
primary source doesn't work so yeah

548
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,559
everybody that's how to add a video to a

549
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,320

all right welcome back everybody so in

555
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,520
this video i'm going to show you all a

556
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,840
few useful text formatting tags that you

557
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,440
may be interested in we'll need some

558
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,799
sample text to work with this is normal

559
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,720
text we'll create additional lines of

560
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,280
text so i'm going to surround this text

561
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,520
with a pair of paragraph tags just so

562
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,440
that when we add additional text they

563
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,360
will be added to a new line let's copy

564
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,440
this line and paste it nine additional

565
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,000
times let's say

566
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
there we go first set of text formatting

567
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,960
tags that i'll show you is bold any text

568
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,200
that you need to bold just surround that

569
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,159
text with a pair of b tags we need an

570
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,799
opening b tag and a closing beats egg

571
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,600
this is normal text and you can see that

572
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,480
the word normal is bold uh let's change

573
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,240
that to bold just so that it's more

574
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,159
descriptive of what it does

575
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,080
okay so any text you need bold just

576
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,080
surround with a pair of b tags the next

577
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,880
set of tags is italic surround any text

578
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,200
that you need italic with a pair of eye

579
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,159
tags this is italic text we have big

580
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,640
this is big text

581
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,280
we have small

582
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:53,280
this is small text sub for subscript

583
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,039
this is subscript text superscript

584
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,280
the tag name is sup like you're saying

585
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,039
sup to somebody

586
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,760
this is superscript text we have

587
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,960
inserted inserted is just underlined

588
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,679
ins for inserted

589
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,320
this is inserted text

590
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,200
there is deleted deleted will create a

591
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,679
line through some text

592
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,000
this is deleted text and there's one

593
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,240
more it looks like i miscounted there's

594
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,000
also marked

595
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,440
so we use a pair of mark tags

596
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,080
any text that is marked is highlighted

597
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,480
so yeah those are a few text formatting

598
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,240
tags that i thought you should know if

599
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,760

if you'd like to become a fellow bro

603
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,039
hey welcome back in this video i'm going

604
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,960
to show you all how we can create lists

605
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,960
in html there's three lists we're going

606
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,360
to talk about unordered ordered and

607
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,360
description lists let's begin with

608
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,360
unordered lists to create an unordered

609
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,880
list we need a pair of ul tags for an

610
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,080
unordered list and between these ul tags

611
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,799
we can create individual list items and

612
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:09,760
we use a pair of li tags for each item

613
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,520
we would like to add to our list so

614
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,440
what's an example of an unordered list

615
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,440
one thing that comes to mind is a

616
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,279
shopping list like a grocery list

617
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,640
because well i'm kind of hungry right

618
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,240
now it's breakfast time let's say that

619
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,240
we're going to bake a pizza and we need

620
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,640
a list of ingredients we need pizza

621
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,840
dough so add an item between this pair

622
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,200
of li tags and we now have one bulleted

623
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,440
item within our unordered list and let's

624
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,440
create another item so we can just copy

625
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,000
and paste this pair of li tags and

626
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,760
create a new list item

627
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,480
what about tomato sauce

628
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,200
and then maybe cheese

629
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,799
and toppings

630
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,960
point being to create an unordered list

631
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,159
you need a pair of ul tags and with each

632
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,000
list item you would like to add to your

633
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,080
unordered list you just place within a

634
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,120
pair of li tags for list item an ordered

635
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,400
list is very similar except we use ol

636
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,120
tags so we need an opening ol tag and a

637
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,080
closing ol tag so by default each list

638
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,400
item is going to be numbered so let's

639
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,200
say that we have a to-do list

640
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,679
to add a list item we need to use a pair

641
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,960
of li tags perhaps this is a schedule of

642
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,640
what we have to do in the morning we

643
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,559
have to eat breakfast

644
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,720
that could be one list item

645
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,880
so to add another item we need another

646
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,200
pair of li tags

647
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,159
then maybe we need to take a shower

648
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,000
so each of these is numbered and they're

649
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,159
in ascending order

650
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,200
and then we want to what about

651
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,400
leave for work okay so yeah that is an

652
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,880
ordered list the order of the list items

653
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,120
does matter and we can change the type

654
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,760
too within the opening oil tag there is

655
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,159
a type attribute we can set each list

656
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,480
item to a number a letter or roman

657
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,520
numerals if i would instead like letters

658
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,760
i can just set the type equal to a and

659
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,520
our list items are now marked with the

660
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,760
letter and we have description lists we

661
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,720
need a pair of dl tags for description

662
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,000
lists

663
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,640
and instead of using an li tag for each

664
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,640
list item we use a pair of dt tags for

665
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,000
description term and dd tags for

666
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,039
description definition so for a term

667
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,080
that is dt and then we add a definition

668
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,880
to this term let's say we have a list of

669
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,679
web dev languages for a term we need an

670
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,520
opening dt tag and a closing dt tag

671
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,279
and then we can add a definition to this

672
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,559
term so that would be dd description

673
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,640
definition between the opening and

674
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,600
closing dd tags we can add a definition

675
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,760
to this term

676
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,640
let's say that this adds

677
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,960
structure to a web page

678
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,880
and then to create another term and

679
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,640
definition pair we can just copy this

680
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,120
let's add css this adds style to a web

681
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,480
page

682
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,799
then javascript

683
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,960
this adds

684
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,799
functionality to a webpage with

685
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,279
description lists each list item is a

686
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:18,159
pair of terms and definitions the last

687
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:19,600
thing i'm going to show you you can

688
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,000
create a nested list within a list so

689
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
let's say i would like to add a sub list

690
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,240
of individual toppings to our unordered

691
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,440
list within the list item we just create

692
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,840
a new list let's say that i would like

693
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,320
another unordered list so i need a pair

694
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,279
of ul tags

695
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,039
and what are some toppings we can place

696
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:42,320
on our pizza so we need a list item

697
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,799
what about pepperoni

698
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,320
so we have a sub list going if you take

699
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,960
a look on the webpage right now oh then

700
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,919
maybe

701
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,360
what about mushrooms next i like

702
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,120
mushrooms

703
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,480
and

704
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,039
peppers i guess all right people those

705
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,039
are how to create lists there's three

706
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,919
types unordered ordered and description

707
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,480
lists just use a pair of appropriate

708
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,080
tags depending on the list you want to

709
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,399
use so yeah everybody that's how to

710
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,720
create different lists in html if you

and in this video i'm going to show you

717
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,120
all how we can create a table using html

718
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:30,159
so sit back relax and enjoy the show

719
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:31,919
everyone i'm going to show you all how

720
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,640
we can create a table using html let's

721
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,440
say that we have a store not an online

722
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,760
store but a brick and mortar store and

723
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,919
our job is to create a table of the

724
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,399
hours of operation for our store

725
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,320
which we can best represent with the

726
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,159
table on our website so to create a

727
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,640
table we'll use a pair of table tags

728
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,159
there's an opening table tag and a

729
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:54,080
closing table tag to add a row to our

730
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,440
table we can use a pair of tr tags for

731
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,760
table row and let's say that we'll have

732
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,320
two rows one for the days of the week

733
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,559
and the other for the hours of operation

734
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,640
so within this first row let's add some

735
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,159
headers using th tags for table header

736
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:11,919
and i'll list the days of the week so we

737
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:14,399
have sunday through saturday so to add

738
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,799
another header just use another pair of

739
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,559
th tags

740
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:19,600
sunday

741
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,760
monday

742
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,039
tuesday

743
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:26,520
you get the rest

744
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,840
table headers are inherently bold if we

745
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,279
would like to add some data to the

746
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,000
second row we'll add that between the tr

747
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,240
tags for the second row

748
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,440
so we would like some data which is td

749
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,679
we need an opening td tag and a closing

750
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:50,559
td tag for each cell let's pretend that

751
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:53,520
our store is open monday through friday

752
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,600
nine to five and closed on the weekends

753
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,159
saturday and sunday this first cell is

754
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:00,320
for the first day sunday the first

755
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,279
column

756
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,399
so we are closed this day let's copy our

757
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,559
table data element and copy it this will

758
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:08,960
be for the second row monday and we are

759
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,320
open nine to five and let's fill this in

760
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,679
for the days monday through friday

761
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,320
and then saturday we are closed

762
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,320
all right let's color in these cells

763
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,880
i'll make the first row a dark gray

764
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,960
color so to change the color of the

765
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,000
first row within the opening tr tag for

766
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,399
the first row there is a bg color

767
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:32,799
attribute which means background color

768
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,720
and i will set the sequel to gray and

769
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,399
our second row let's make this light

770
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:39,679
gray so within the opening tr tag for

771
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:41,679
the second row let's set the bg color

772
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,679
attribute equal to a different color

773
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,600
like light gray pick whatever color you

774
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,120
want it doesn't necessarily have to be

775
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,880
gray so within the opening table tag i

776
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,159
will set the bg color equal to what

777
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:55,600
about black

778
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,159
cool these cells are left aligned we can

779
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,640
center them to center the cells within a

780
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,000
row within the opening tr tag there is

781
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,399
an align attribute and let's set this

782
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:09,440
equal to center and the text is now

783
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,679
centered and lastly let's make all of

784
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:14,320
these cells the same size this wednesday

785
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,480
cell is taking up a lot of space let's

786
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,799
set the width equal to maybe 100 pixels

787
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:24,080
and i will just copy this

788
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,120
and with the opening table element i

789
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,760
will set this equal to the width of each

790
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,760
cell times the number of cells that we

791
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,120
have so if each cell has a width of 100

792
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,440
and there's seven cells i will set the

793
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,039
width equal to 700.

794
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,279
and well there we go all of these cells

795
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:45,279
are now aligned so yeah that's how to

796
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:48,960
create a table in html just use a pair

797
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,480
of table tags for each row add a pair of

798
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,039
tr tags if you need a row to function as

799
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,679
a header such as the days of the week

800
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:00,640
use th tags if you're filling in data

801
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:05,039
for a cell use td tags for table data so

802
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,039
yeah that's how to create a table in

803
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:09,120
html if you found this video helpful

fellow bro

808
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,559
hey uh what's going on everybody in this

809
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,159
video i'm going to show you how we can

810
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:23,440
add color to a webpage so sit back relax

811
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,320
and enjoy the show

812
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:28,480
all right now here's how we can add

813
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,799
color to a web page we'll be talking a

814
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,960
little bit about css but we'll cover

815
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,919
this more in depth in the css series i

816
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:37,440
thought this would be a good place for

817
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,679
us to introduce colors because we'll be

818
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:42,159
able to color things like buttons and

819
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:44,240
forms and whatnot here's how to add some

820
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,640
color to a webpage within the opening

821
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,039
tag of an element of your choosing

822
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,840
there is a style attribute and within

823
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,720
double quotes we can add css properties

824
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,799
for my website i would like to change

825
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:59,120
the background color to black because i

826
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,640
think it would look cool so within

827
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,039
double quotes list the css property you

828
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,360
would like to change background color

829
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,679
after the colon you can either add a

830
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,360
color name rgb values or hexadecimal

831
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,760
values let's just say the color black

832
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,279
there we go we can no longer see my

833
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:17,679
website let's change the font color of

834
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:20,720
these individual h1 header tags again

835
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,880
it's the same process as before

836
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,039
style equals

837
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:27,600
within double quotes list the css

838
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,679
property you would like to add

839
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:31,840
i would like to add color this time to

840
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,880
change the font color and i will pick

841
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,320
red there we go this time let's use rgb

842
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,080
values

843
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,120
so again style attribute equals the css

844
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,600
property would like to change

845
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,840
to instead use an rgb value type rgb

846
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,760
parenthesis then i would recommend

847
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,000
looking up a color picker

848
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,240
and you can pick a color of whatever you

849
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,880
would like uh what about blue

850
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,480
perhaps that shade of blue so rgb values

851
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,440
are in a group of three a triad

852
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,919
so i will copy these three numbers and

853
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,119
paste them within the parentheses of rgb

854
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,000
and the second h1 header tag is now that

855
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,560
specific shade of blue i tend to prefer

856
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,159
to use rgb values or hexadecimal values

857
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,000
over color names because you have more

858
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,040
variety now let's use hexadecimal values

859
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,800
style equals the css property

860
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,879
of color

861
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:33,119
so hexadecimal values always start with

862
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:34,399
a hashtag

863
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,480
what about green

864
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,199
so we'll have red blue and green and i

865
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,520
will copy this number they are in groups

866
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,800
of six and well yeah it's green now cool

867
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,440
right okay now let's change both the

868
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,760
font color and the background color of

869
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,320
this paragraph within the opening tag of

870
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,560
this paragraph element

871
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,760
we will set the style attribute equal

872
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,240
to any css properties within double

873
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,200
quotes

874
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,079
let's change the background color first

875
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:05,359
background

876
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:06,720
dash color

877
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,160
colon space

878
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,079
i'll set this to

879
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:12,079
dark gray which is

880
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:13,680
2 2 2

881
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,400
2 2 2 then to add multiple css

882
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,240
properties separate each with a

883
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,960
semicolon and this time i will change

884
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,440
just the color and i'll use the same

885
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,520
shade of green all right well there we

886
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,000
go so yeah everybody that's how to add

887
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,079
some colors to your webpage there's more

888
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:31,839

the video series on css but what you can

890
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,359
do for now within the opening tag of an

891
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:39,760
element of your choosing set the style

892
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,680
attribute equal

893
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,839
to whatever css properties you would

894
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:46,400
like to add within quotes so yeah that's

895
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,480

you'd like to become a fellow bro

900
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,040
hey welcome back in this video i'm going

901
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,320
to explain the span and div tags let's

902
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,240
begin with span span adds markup to text

903
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,119
or portion of a document anything that i

904
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,839
surround with a pair of spam tags i can

905
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,880
apply markup or some effect to so in my

906
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,520
example document i have a header and

907
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,000
three paragraphs what if i would like

908
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
this specific sentence to be i don't

909
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,920
know red well what i could do is

910
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,400
surround this sentence in my document

911
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,880
with a pair of spam tags

912
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,200
so i need an opening spam tag and a

913
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,880
closing spam tag

914
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,440
and that sentence ends right here and

915
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,000
within the span tag i can change some of

916
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,720
the attributes of this sentence um so i

917
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,960
would like to change maybe the style

918
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,640
i'll set the style color equal to red

919
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,720
now you probably do want this closing

920
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,440
tag if you do not have this closing tag

921
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,520
your span will take up this entire

922
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,800
section

923
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,520
so basically that's what span is it adds

924
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,720
markup to text or a portion of a

925
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,839
document div is very similar except it

926
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:08,400
divides a division of a document so what

927
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,400
if i would like to change the background

928
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,119
color of these three paragraphs well

929
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:14,800
what we learned in the last video on

930
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,640
colors is that we could set the style

931
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,000
background

932
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,320
color equal to some shade of gray maybe

933
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,040
this value this does work and i could

934
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,280
just copy this and paste it for each of

935
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,440
these paragraphs

936
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,760
or another way of doing this is that i

937
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,560
can surround these three paragraphs with

938
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,720
a pair of div tags

939
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,880
so we need an opening div tag

940
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,839
and a closing div tag

941
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:46,079
and then i will apply this style

942
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:49,119
attribute to the opening div tag

943
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:50,640
and it will apply

944
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,359
this attribute to anything between these

945
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,599
div tags so yeah that's basically what

946
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,640
the span and div tags do span adds

947
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,520
markup to text or portion of a document

948
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,240
div defines a division of a document so

949
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:09,040
yeah that's span and div in html

950
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:13,359
yeah let's begin so meta tags the meta

951
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:16,160
element represents various kinds of

952
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,040
metadata that cannot be expressed using

953
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,920
the title base link style and script

954
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,599
elements metadata is data about data we

955
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:28,240
can add metadata to the head of our

956
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,480
document and this tells the web browser

957
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,720
what our web page is about with the meta

958
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,960
tags we place them within the head not

959
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,040
the body so we can tell the web browser

960
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,359
some information about our web page meta

961
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,839
tags are self closing we do not need a

962
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:44,800
closing tag meta tags do have a name

963
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,960
attribute that we can set to one of many

964
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,880
settings let's say we would like to add

965
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,440
a description to this webpage and the

966
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,200
web browser is going to read this

967
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,920
description after setting the name equal

968
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,560
to description i can set the content

969
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,880
equal to a brief description of my

970
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,000
webpage

971
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,240
uh perhaps free

972
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,000
html tutorial for beginners

973
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,400
okay so that's one example of a meta tag

974
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,960
so let's create another so meta again

975
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,280
these are self-closing tags and i can

976
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,440
add some keywords for search engine

977
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,960
optimization

978
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,040
so name keywords

979
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,160
content

980
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,320
and i'll explain my web page in just a

981
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,280
few keywords uh perhaps html separate

982
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,119
each of these with a comma

983
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:30,960
tutorial

984
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,000
beginners

985
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,800
that'd be good we can add a author

986
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,720
meta name

987
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,440
equals author

988
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:44,160
content equals and then type your name

989
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,320
so if somebody is viewing your web page

990
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,640
on a mobile device you can have your web

991
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,119
page scale to their mobile device by

992
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:54,480
adding this meta tag name equals

993
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,720
viewport

994
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,000
content

995
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,079
equals

996
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,240
and this will set the width of our web

997
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,359
page

998
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:07,440
equal to device dash width

999
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,400
then comma we can set the initial

1000
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,520
scale

1001
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,119
equal to 1.0 so by adding this meta tag

1002
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:16,960
if you were to view this webpage on a

1003
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,680
mobile device this web page will scale

1004
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,000
proportionately with that mobile device

1005
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,079
another meta tag is a char set

1006
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:27,839
we can tell a web browser what sort of

1007
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:29,920
character encoding that we're using

1008
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,880
so authors are encouraged to use utf-8

1009
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,319
for unicode

1010
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:36,160
so if you want to use basic ascii

1011
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,760
encoding you would write ascii here

1012
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,160
although that's discouraged authors are

1013
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,520
encouraged to use utf-8 for unicode

1014
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,720
all right and the last thing i'm going

1015
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,960
to show you is that we can set our web

1016
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,520
page to automatically refresh after a

1017
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,119
given amount of seconds

1018
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,040
so meta

1019
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,720
http

1020
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,319
dash equiv is the attribute name

1021
00:40:58,319 --> 00:40:59,520
equals

1022
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,920
refresh

1023
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,640
and the content equals how many seconds

1024
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,920
you would like to wait to have your

1025
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,440
browser refresh

1026
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,440
uh perhaps 30.

1027
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,839
okay so i'm going to open this with live

1028
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:14,319
server so if i set this to 30 seconds

1029
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:16,720
it's not going to be that visible you're

1030
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,640
gonna have to wait until we see this

1031
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,560
refresh let's set this to something more

1032
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,720
drastic like two seconds let's crank

1033
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,440
this up yep see it's refreshing every

1034
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,520
two seconds uh but let's set that back

1035
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,160
to 30. two seconds was just an example

1036
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,160
so yeah those are meta tags they

1037
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,480
represent metadata

1038
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,200
is data about data by adding meta tags

1039
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,599
we can tell a web browser information

1040
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:41,839
about our website such as a brief

1041
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:44,720
description keywords author we can set

1042
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,040
the viewport for mobile devices you can

1043
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,280
set a refresh rate stuff like that and

1044
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,599
then be sure to add meta tags to the

1045
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:54,240
head element of your document so yeah

1046
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,240
those are meta tags if you found this

1047
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,160
video helpful please remember to smash

1048
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,760
that like button leave a random comment

1049
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,599
down below and subscribe if you'd like

1050
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,839
to become a fellow bro

1051
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:05,760
hey what's going on everybody it's you

1052
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,520
bro hope you're doing well and in this

1053
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,960
video i'm going to explain how we can

1054
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,000
use iframes to embed web pages and other

1055
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,400
documents within your website so sit

1056
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,839
back relax and enjoy the show

1057
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,680
hey welcome back iframes the iframe

1058
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,240
element is used to embed content from

1059
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,359
another source into an html document

1060
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:30,160
they're commonly used for advertisements

1061
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,319
and they're easily abused with many

1062
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:34,560
hacking techniques so basically using an

1063
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,800
iframe we can embed another web page

1064
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,280
within our webpage or we could embed our

1065
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,000
current html document with another html

1066
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,520
document here's how we can create an

1067
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,319
iframe this is a self-closing tag and we

1068
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:49,200
set the source equal to this can be an

1069
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,640
external website such as a url or we can

1070
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,280
place a relative file path to a file of

1071
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,440
our choosing so this doesn't work with

1072
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,079
many websites and i'll demonstrate that

1073
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:02,920
so let's set the source equal to

1074
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:06,400
google.com and then save and reload so

1075
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,040
google.com refused to connect that's

1076
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,359
because a lot of major websites have

1077
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:13,599
disabled the use of iframes since we're

1078
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:15,520
embedding another web page within our

1079
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,240
webpage a common hacking technique is

1080
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,119
that you can have this embedded webpage

1081
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:23,359
take up the entire frame of your html

1082
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:25,760
document your website could pose as

1083
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,440
another website and that could be

1084
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,359
considered dangerous let's say that you

1085
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:31,599
embed a banking website like bank of

1086
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:33,599
america so if somebody visits your

1087
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:35,680
website it's actually a facade and

1088
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,280
somebody will type in their banking

1089
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,440
information like their login credentials

1090
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,440
and you could capture that so a lot of

1091
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,680
major websites have disabled the use of

1092
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,160
iframes so you cannot pose as their

1093
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,400
website one website that i checked that

1094
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,640
does work is bing

1095
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,760
so let's switch our url to that save and

1096
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,520
reload

1097
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,760
yeah see we have embedded the home page

1098
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,000
of bing but let's change the width and

1099
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,760
height attributes because this is fairly

1100
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,839
small let's say the width is

1101
00:44:04,839 --> 00:44:07,760
750 pixels and for the height let's say

1102
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,920
maybe 250.

1103
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,000
so save and reload

1104
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,400
cool yeah we have embedded bing within

1105
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,000
our webpage and you can use this

1106
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,040
normally

1107
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:17,839
bro

1108
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:20,000
code

1109
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,160
now let's embed another document so

1110
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,480
let's create a new file

1111
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,839
let's pretend that this is an

1112
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:27,520
advertisement we would like to display

1113
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,960
within our webpage i'll name this

1114
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:33,280
add.html so if you're using vs code to

1115
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,920
generate an html document a plain one

1116
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,800
type exclamation point then hit tab

1117
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,560
so let's say something

1118
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,480
i'll use an h1 header tag

1119
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,839
this is an advertisement

1120
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:48,000
and then close it uh let's change the

1121
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,400
background color too using the style

1122
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,680
attribute

1123
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:54,240
and i will pick the background color

1124
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,880
property and set this to maybe i don't

1125
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,440
know that color uh then let's change the

1126
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,440
width and height for the height maybe

1127
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,440
100

1128
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,280
then make sure to change your source as

1129
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,599
well so we need to list the relative

1130
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:09,760
file path since these files are right

1131
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,440
next to each other i only have to list

1132
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,000
the file name

1133
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,960
add.html save reload

1134
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,839
cool and there is my fake advertisement

1135
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:22,160
embedded pages do have a border this is

1136
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,800
how to remove that set the style

1137
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,160
attribute

1138
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:30,319
equal to the border css property and set

1139
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:34,880
this to zero so i'm going to save reload

1140
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,599
and this no longer has that border so

1141
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:40,319
yeah everybody those are iframes they're

1142
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:42,400
used to embed content from another

1143
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,119
source into an html document they're

1144
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,359
useful for advertisements and they're

1145
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:49,359
easily abused with a lot of hacking

1146
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:52,079
techniques so yeah those are iframes if

1147
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:54,240
you learn something new be sure to smash

1148
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,920
that like button drop a random comment

1149
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,760
down below and subscribe if you'd like

1150
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,599
to become a fellow bro

1151
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:01,760
what's going on everybody it's you bro

1152
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,520
hope you're doing well and in this video

1153
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,960
i'm going to show you how you can create

1154
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,240
a button using html so sit back relax

1155
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:11,119
and enjoy the show

1156
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:13,599
hey in this video i'm going to show you

1157
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:16,240
how we can create buttons using html

1158
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,880
we'll need a pair of button tags there's

1159
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,480
an opening button tag and a closing

1160
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,200
button tag here's our button to add some

1161
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,000
text between the button tags we can add

1162
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,240
whatever text we want to the button like

1163
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,200
click me

1164
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,200
you can set this up as a hyperlink when

1165
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,800
you click on the button to do so just

1166
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,880
surround your button element with a pair

1167
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,400
of a tags

1168
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,319
there's an opening a tag and a closing a

1169
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:39,200
tag

1170
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,079
and i will set the href attribute of the

1171
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:45,280
opening button tag to a url or relative

1172
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,359
file path of my choosing to make this

1173
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:52,640
simple let's set the url to google.com

1174
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:56,160
and then when i click on this button it

1175
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,319
takes me to google you can disable a

1176
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:01,040
button by adding a disabled boolean

1177
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,520
attribute to the opening button tag and

1178
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,839
we can no longer click on this button

1179
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:08,000
if you know a little bit of css you can

1180
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,400
add some css properties directly to a

1181
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,280
button by setting the style attribute

1182
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,480
equal to and list some css properties of

1183
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,560
your choosing let's change the

1184
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,960
background color

1185
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,559
you can pick a color name

1186
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:27,599
you can use rgb values

1187
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:31,520
or you can use hexadecimal values

1188
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,000
i think i'll set this to a dark gray

1189
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,839
color so maybe

1190
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:37,280
6 3s

1191
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,920
for rgb values and hexadecimal values

1192
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,640
you can always use a color picker online

1193
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,040
so if you would like to add multiple css

1194
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,839
properties separate each css property

1195
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:50,480
with a semicolon and next i will change

1196
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:53,200
the color that's the font color and

1197
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,680
maybe i'll pick green one color i like

1198
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:59,280
is zero zero ff zero zero that's just a

1199
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,520
bright green color you can also round

1200
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,319
these borders too by using the border

1201
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:07,280
radius property so again separate each

1202
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,920
css property with a semicolon

1203
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,960
and i will set the border radius

1204
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,599
property to 5 pixels just around the

1205
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:16,880
corners

1206
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,240
okay cool

1207
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,319
that's a pretty fancy looking button if

1208
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:22,400
i do say so myself and yep it still

1209
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,520
takes us to google just by us using html

1210
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,079
this adds structure to a webpage but it

1211
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:30,480
doesn't necessarily add functionality

1212
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,480
that's where a language like javascript

1213
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,400
comes in when we click on a button we

1214
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,559
can have this button execute some

1215
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:38,559
function from a javascript file i'll

1216
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:41,119
show you how we can create a very simple

1217
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:43,200
javascript program but of course we'll

1218
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,079
cover this more in the javascript series

1219
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,720
so let's get rid of this hyperlink

1220
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,040
and have our button do something else

1221
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,640
there is an on

1222
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,440
click attribute that we can set to a

1223
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,200
javascript function

1224
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,800
so we just place the name of the

1225
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,920
function between a set of double quotes

1226
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,839
we haven't created a javascript function

1227
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:05,599
yet but let's say that we'll have a

1228
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:08,640
javascript function named do something

1229
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,160
and then follow that name with a set of

1230
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,960
parentheses and let's create a paragraph

1231
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,880
element

1232
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,480
and we will say hello and then close it

1233
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,640
with this paragraph element i'm going to

1234
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:24,079
set the id attribute equal to let's say

1235
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:26,319
test here's how we can code a very

1236
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:29,040
simple javascript program you're going

1237
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,920
to create a pair of script tags there's

1238
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,599
an opening script tag and a closing

1239
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:35,680
script tag

1240
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,480
and within the script i will say

1241
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,079
function

1242
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:41,520
do something

1243
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,480
parentheses curly braces

1244
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,880
so this function will perform some

1245
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,200
subsection of code so when we click on

1246
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,440
our button what do we want this program

1247
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,880
to do we will take document dot

1248
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:55,839
get

1249
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:56,839
element

1250
00:49:56,839 --> 00:49:59,040
by id

1251
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,400
parentheses

1252
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,359
list the id of our paragraph element

1253
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:04,640
test

1254
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,599
dot

1255
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:06,800
inner

1256
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,480
html

1257
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,040
and i will set the sequel to

1258
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,640
goodbye

1259
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:15,520
then add a semicolon at the end okay so

1260
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,440
when we click on this button it's going

1261
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,400
to execute this function do something

1262
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,240
and then perform whatever code is

1263
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,720
between this set of curly braces

1264
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,720
so you may need to save

1265
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,960
refresh your web page and if done

1266
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,440
correctly when you click on this button

1267
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,760
it will change this text

1268
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,200
from hello

1269
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,480
to goodbye

1270
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,200
so that is a very small javascript

1271
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,599
program so there is an on click

1272
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:44,319
attribute that you can set equal to a

1273
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:46,640
javascript function but of course we'll

1274
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,040
cover more about javascript well in the

1275
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,200
javascript playlist but that's one way

1276
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,119
in which you can add functionality to a

1277
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:55,119
button in this video we were more

1278
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:57,200
focused on actually creating the button

1279
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,359
itself so yeah if this video helped you

1280
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:01,359
out you can help me out by smashing that

1281
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:03,040
like button leave a random comment down

1282
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,800

become a fellow bro

1284
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:09,760
hey everyone i'm going to try and

1285
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,839
explain everything i can about forms in

1286
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:13,760
about eight minutes to create a form

1287
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,000
element we'll need a pair of form tags

1288
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,520
there's an opening form tag and a

1289
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,280
closing form tag and depending on the

1290
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,280
user input that you need there is an

1291
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,599
input element and you can set the type

1292
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:26,000
attribute to whatever you need let's say

1293
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
we need some text from a user like a

1294
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,319
first name within our form there is a

1295
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:32,079
text box where we can enter in some user

1296
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:33,839
information so we should probably let

1297
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:35,520
the user know what we want them to type

1298
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,160
in i will precede this input element

1299
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,640
with a label

1300
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,000
let's say first name and a user can type

1301
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,160
in their first name now it is considered

1302
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,480
good practice to fill out a for

1303
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,119
attribute within the label and set this

1304
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:53,680
to whatever you want let's say fname and

1305
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,839
within the associated input elements i

1306
00:51:55,839 --> 00:51:59,359
will set the id also equal to fname

1307
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:01,680
whatever's within the four attribute

1308
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,920
this does a couple things one if i was

1309
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,800
to click on this label this will select

1310
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,440
my input box it's also helpful for

1311
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,440
people that are using screen readers so

1312
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,599
that they can easily navigate your form

1313
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:16,240
there is also a name attribute when we

1314
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,480
submit this data what sort of name do we

1315
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,240
want to give that data think of it like

1316
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,640
a variable i will also name this fname

1317
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,960
as well within the input element there

1318
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,280
is a placeholder to display some default

1319
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,520
text to a user by setting the

1320
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:32,559
placeholder attribute equal to some text

1321
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:35,040
like spongebob so if i was to click

1322
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:37,280
within this input field and type

1323
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,720
something that will get rid of my

1324
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,880
placeholder let's create an input field

1325
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,640
for a last name and really we can just

1326
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:45,280
copy this and make a few changes to it

1327
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,440
so copy both the label and the input

1328
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,240
element uh let's change this from first

1329
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,319
name to last name

1330
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:54,880
change four as well to lname

1331
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,680
id will be lname and let's make name l

1332
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:58,880
name as well

1333
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,200
and the placeholder how about square

1334
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,319
pants

1335
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:04,079
these labels and input elements will

1336
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:06,400
appear on the same line to separate them

1337
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,319
and treat them as block level elements i

1338
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:10,640
will add each of these pairs to their

1339
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:14,440
own div element

1340
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:19,359
perhaps i'll add a line break as well

1341
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:21,440
okay now with forms there are built-in

1342
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,160
buttons too

1343
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,559
we will set the input type equal to

1344
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:31,440
reset so if i were to type in some text

1345
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,599
and click reset that will reset

1346
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:35,760
whatever's within my form and there is a

1347
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,720
submit button as well

1348
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:41,760
i will set the type equal to submit so

1349
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,520
currently our data doesn't have any

1350
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:46,079
place to go to so if i were to click the

1351
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:48,160
submit button this data is not going to

1352
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,559
go anywhere so if i need to send this

1353
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:53,200
data to a page i will list that page

1354
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,440
within the action attribute of my

1355
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,520
opening form element

1356
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,359
so we'll need the help of a dynamic

1357
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:02,000
programming language php for example

1358
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,280
we're not going to focus on

1359
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:04,880
functionality in this video but rather

1360
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:07,040
the structure of a form so if i need to

1361
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,400
send this to

1362
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,599
a php page i will list that php page

1363
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:13,760
within the action attribute there is

1364
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,319
also an associated method attribute two

1365
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:20,240
common values are get and post

1366
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,720
get is considered insecure it's going to

1367
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:25,599
append your data to the url of your web

1368
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:27,839
page so for example if i set the method

1369
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:30,079
to get and type in some information

1370
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:33,040
and click submit it's going to append my

1371
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,920
data to the end of my url so it's going

1372
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,920
to add a question mark then all of my

1373
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,000
data if you need to submit some secure

1374
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,240
information like a password do not use

1375
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,160
get i would say that this is useful for

1376
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,640
things like search boxes if a user needs

1377
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,640
to navigate your web page for maybe some

1378
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,640
sort of keyword so it's better to use

1379
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:53,200
post to submit some secure information

1380
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,480
but this isn't going to do anything

1381
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,240
obviously because we do not have a

1382
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,880
server set up now there is a required

1383
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,720
boolean attribute you can add if

1384
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,000
somebody needs to submit some

1385
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,720
information they are required to fill

1386
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,880
out any input elements that have this

1387
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,200
boolean attribute of required so if i

1388
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,640
just attempt to submit this without

1389
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,720
typing in anything there is a small

1390
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,799
pop-up box that says please fill out

1391
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:16,720
this field all right i'm going to go

1392
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,559
kind of quick through these next input

1393
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:20,319
elements just because i think we have

1394
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:22,960
the hang of the general context of input

1395
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,920
elements so next we have password fields

1396
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,480
you set the type equal to password so if

1397
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,480
somebody types in characters they will

1398
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,799
be hidden if you need to set a max size

1399
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:35,680
of your password there is a max length

1400
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:38,000
attribute let's set this to maybe 12 so

1401
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
we can type in no more than 12

1402
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,920
characters for a password and you can

1403
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,400
also add that required boolean attribute

1404
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:45,280
too

1405
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:48,240
for an email element set the type equal

1406
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,960
to email

1407
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,920
in order to submit an email we need an

1408
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,240
at character within our email otherwise

1409
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,160
we cannot submit this information and

1410
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,799
perhaps i'll add a placeholder as well

1411
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:03,119
placeholder equals s

1412
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:04,079
pants

1413
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:06,720
at gmail.com

1414
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,119
so there is our placeholder for a

1415
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:11,119
telephone number you're going to set the

1416
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:13,680
type equal to tell

1417
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:16,480
and i do have a placeholder as well if

1418
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:18,960
you need the user to type in a date like

1419
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:22,480
a birth date there is a type date which

1420
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,400
includes an interactive calendar to

1421
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,160
select a date

1422
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,400
a user can type in a number if you set

1423
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,559
the type equal to number let's say that

1424
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:32,400
the user is buying something from a

1425
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,400
store there are some arrows where they

1426
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,720
can increase or decrease the quantity

1427
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,480
but we should probably place some limits

1428
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,920
they can type in basically whatever

1429
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:42,160
number they want they want negative one

1430
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,680
billion items

1431
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,760
so we can set the min and the max i'll

1432
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:49,119
set the min equal to 0 and of the max

1433
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:51,920
equal to what about 99

1434
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:54,079
and you can also set a default value too

1435
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:56,799
i'll set the default value equal to 1.

1436
00:56:56,799 --> 00:56:58,720
next we have radio buttons with radio

1437
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,720
buttons we can only select one radio

1438
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,880
button from any one group perhaps we'll

1439
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,200
have the user select a title are they a

1440
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:08,079
mr a miss or a doctor

1441
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:10,480
so i'm going to create a pair of labels

1442
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:13,760
and input for each option that we have

1443
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,240
so we will have a mr option

1444
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,280
miss

1445
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,440
and

1446
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:22,640
phd okay i will set the input type equal

1447
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:25,119
to radio and then do that with each of

1448
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:27,680
these pairs

1449
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:30,000
so we can select more than one because

1450
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,480
these are all not within the same group

1451
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,400
to set them all within the same group we

1452
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,160
will all have them have the same

1453
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,680
matching name

1454
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:40,720
let's say that the name will be title

1455
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,720
so therefore we can only select one now

1456
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:44,559
since they're all within the same group

1457
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:46,240
and that's kind of the idea behind radio

1458
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:48,480
buttons you can only select one and we

1459
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:51,839
will set an associated value of let's

1460
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:54,799
say mister for the first value

1461
00:57:54,799 --> 00:57:56,799
misses for the second

1462
00:57:56,799 --> 00:57:59,440
and doctor for the last one

1463
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,200
then i'm just going to precede all of

1464
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,720
these with a separate label

1465
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:07,520
uh let's say title

1466
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:10,079
and i will set the four attribute equal

1467
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:12,640
to title and within each of these radio

1468
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,319
button labels when i click on one of

1469
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:16,240
these labels i also want to be able to

1470
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,480
select one of these radio buttons so i

1471
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,559
will set the for attribute equal to a

1472
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:23,760
unique id so let's say mister

1473
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,480
the id will be mister

1474
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:29,680
and repeat the same steps

1475
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:35,440
okay so when we click on these labels we

1476
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,119
should be able to select our radio

1477
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:38,160
buttons

1478
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:41,119
nice with drop down menus instead of a

1479
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:43,599
type we are going to use a pair of

1480
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:46,000
select tags so there's an opening select

1481
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,400
tag and a closing select tag and we list

1482
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,720
individual options within the select

1483
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:53,119
element

1484
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:55,040
we'll give our user three options from

1485
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:57,520
this drop down menu they can pay with a

1486
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:01,280
visa a mastercard or a gift card

1487
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:05,480
and i will give each of these a value

1488
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,480
okay we now have a payment field and the

1489
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,400
user can select an option from this drop

1490
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,760
down menu

1491
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,599
and the last input type i will explain

1492
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:18,880
in this video is the checkbox type so

1493
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,880
let's say we have a subscribe button and

1494
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,720
you can go ahead and smash that

1495
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,720
subscribe button so just set the type

1496
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:27,680
equal to checkbox for well a checkbox

1497
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,760
well yeah everybody that's how to create

1498
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,760
an html form there's still some more

1499
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,839
advanced input types we did not cover

1500
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:35,599
but these are the very basics i would

1501
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:37,520
